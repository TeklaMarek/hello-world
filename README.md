# hello-world
My very first GitHub action

Hellow World!

This is my very first attempt at using GitHub. I hope I can learn to use this successfully. 
I'm really ready to learn coding for real, and transition from retail sales to a data analysis type career. I also love Premier League Football. 
Liverpool are going to be the League Champions this year despite the pandemic and what the haters say.
